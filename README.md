# Multilayer Network Community Extraction

A port of James D. Wilson's [Multilayer Network Community Extraction](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-645/16-645.pdf) package in R to Python. 
This version keeps the function calls very similar to the R calls, and attempts to use similar data structures
to keep accurate results through the process.

## Getting Started - TODO

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This module uses NetworkX over iGraph for the graph manipulations.
Aside from this, only commonly used Python modules are used.

```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install networkx
```

### Installing - TODO

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests - TODO

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests - TODO

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests - TODO

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment - TODO

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
