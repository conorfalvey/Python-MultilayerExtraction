#' dataset: AU_CS
#'
#' Data set that contains the multilayer network describing the multilayer relationships among attendees to an Austrailian computer science conference.
#' In total, there were 61 attendees (represented by the nodes in each layer), and 5 relationships that are represented by the layers in the network. The
#' data is provided in a list format where each entry represents a different layer, and the type of relationship is represented by the name of the list entry.
